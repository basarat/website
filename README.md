Zed website (zedapp.org)
=======
This repo contains the files from which the zedapp.org site can be generated. To generate the site the `gh:zefhemel/zcms` Zed package is used, which will automatically be installed and enabled for this project if you open this folder in [Zed](http://zedapp.org).

To generate the entire site, run the `ZCMS:Generate Full Site` command (or hit `Ctrl-Shift-C`, the output will be written to the `/out` directory (which is hidden from Zed's file list, but you can see it on the file system). To test the site run the `ZCMS:Start Webserver` command.

For more info on zcms, have a look [at its Github page](https://github.com/zefhemel/zcms).
