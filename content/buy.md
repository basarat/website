Donate
======

Do you like Zed? So do we! We'd like to spend more time on it, but it's not always easy to fund that time. Therefore we're asking for donations.

For users:

*   [Gratipay][2]. With Gratipay (fka. Gittip) you commit to a weekly donation. A weekly contribution of $1-$5 (or whatever it's worth to you) would go a long way to make the project sustainable. <script data-gittip-username="zefhemel" data-gittip-widget="button" src="//gttp.co/v1.js"></script>
*   Paypal: if you prefer to make a one-time donation (or at the pace you're comfortable with) you can send your donations via Paypal to `zef@zef.me`
*   [Bitcoin][3]. By now you must have heard of [this digital currency][4]. You can send your donations to the address: `16sykahXZSXsbiMgg1CyjRVbyG7y95wLR6`

For companies:

*   Sponsorship: work for a company that wants to contribute to open source? Zed has a big audience of ahead-of-the-curve developers. Sponsors are displayed with logo and link on every page of the Zed website. Interested? Get in touch: zefhemel@gmail.com
