Zed is available in two editions: a *Chrome App* version installed right into Chrome (works on Mac, Windows, Linux and ChromeOS) and a *Standalone* version not dependent on a browser (for Mac, Windows and Linux).

**Current version:** [1.0 (changelog)](/2014/09/the-changelog-1-0)

Pick your favorite edition:

*   [Zed Chrome App][2] (installation takes just 3 clicks in Chrome) and the accompanying [Edit in Zed][3] extension (makes all `textarea`s editable in Zed)
*   [Zed Standalone for Mac][4]
*   [Zed Standalone for Windows][5]
*   [Zed Standalone for Linux 64-bit][6]
*   [Zed Standalone for Linux 32-bit][7]
